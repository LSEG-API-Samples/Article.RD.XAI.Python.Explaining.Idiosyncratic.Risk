# Idiosyncratic risk ranking using eXplainable AI


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
No investment is free of all possible market risks, even the safest investments can be subject to underline risk constituents that can affect their performance. Quantifying risk is a key process within the modern financial investing ecosystem as it allows managers to hedge part of it using various diversification strategies.

In this prototype we use the Single Index Model to generate a target variable mimicking idiosyncratic risk. We then write a self-explainable AI model that can rank company idiosyncratic risk.

Details and concepts are further explained in the [Idiosyncratic risk ranking using eXplainable AI]().
